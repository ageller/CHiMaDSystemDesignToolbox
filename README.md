# CHiMaD System Design Toolbox

An app for collaboratively creating system design charts. 

A live version is available [here](http://chimad-trainings.rcs.northwestern.edu/).

Basic instructions:
1.  Go to the CHiMaD System Design Toolbox main page [here](http://chimad-trainings.rcs.northwestern.edu/), and login with your group name.
2.	Go to [this page](http://chimad-trainings.rcs.northwestern.edu/editPara) to create/edit your paragraph.
	* You can use the dropdown menu to select an existing paragraph as a starting point.
	* Click the "edit" button and change the text in the text box to your paragraph, using the encoding described on the page.
	* Enter a new name for your paragraph that does not already exit and click "save".
	* You should then see your paragraph with words youâ€™ve identified in boxes, and a beginning system design chart with white boxes in random locations.
	* Click on a boxed word in the paragraph to show the dropdown; select the desired category.  When you select a category, the corresponding box in the SDC will move to the right location.  Repeat for all boxed words in the paragraph.
	* Within the SDC, draw connection lines by clicking in a box and dragging to another box in the adjacent column (moving from left to right).
3.	For the training version, you can go to [this page](http://chimad-trainings.rcs.northwestern.edu/training) and select your new paragraph from the dropdown menu.  (Follow the usual steps to submit your initial and then final answers for each step.)
4.	To edit the SDC directly, you can go to [this page](http://chimad-trainings.rcs.northwestern.edu/editSDC) and select your new paragraph from the dropdown menu.
	* There are various toggles that you can use to display the results from the training task.
