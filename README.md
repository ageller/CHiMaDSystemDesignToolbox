# CHiMaD Test Para Form

Testing a paragraph with dropdowns submitting to a google Sheet

A live version is available [here](https://ageller.github.io/CHiMaDTestParaForm/).

Basic instructions:
1.	Go to [this page](https://ageller.github.io/CHiMaDTestParaForm/editPara.html) to create/edit your paragraph.
	* You can use the dropdown menu to select an existing paragraph as a starting point.
	* Click the "edit" button and change the text in the text box to your paragraph, using the encoding described on the page.
	* Enter a new name for your paragraph that does not already exit and click "save".
	* You should then see your paragraph with words youâ€™ve identified in boxes, and a beginning system design chart with white boxes in random locations.
	* Click on a boxed word in the paragraph to show the dropdown; select the desired category.  When you select a category, the corresponding box in the SDC will move to the right location.  Repeat for all boxed words in the paragraph.
	* Within the SDC, draw connection lines by clicking in a box and dragging to another box in the adjacent column (moving from left to right).
2.	For the training version, you can go to [this page](https://ageller.github.io/CHiMaDTestParaForm/index.html) and select your new paragraph from the dropdown menu.  (Follow the usual steps to submit your version 1 and then version 2 answers for each step.)
3.	To edit the SDC directly, you can go to [this page](https://ageller.github.io/CHiMaDTestParaForm/editSDC.html) and select your new paragraph from the dropdown menu.
	* There are various toggles that you can use to display the results from the training task.
	* Follow the instructions on the page to edit the SDC.
	* When you are finished, you can either export to png or pptx (please try those on your end to make sure they work as expected).
