Polymer Composite Example,"Polymer matrix composites are traditionally valued for use in [[lightweight mechanical]] applications (aerospace, automotive, etc.) due to their attractive combination of mechanical properties ([[toughness]], [[strength/stiffness]]) and [[low density]]. For use in [[extreme environments]], these materials must possess [[slow degradation rates when exposed to O_{2}_, H_{2}_O, and salts]]. Moreover, maintaining structural integrity over a wide temperature range requires a low [[thermal expansion coefficient mismatch]] between matrix/reinforcement and a high [[glass transition temperature (T_{g}_)]]. Composites must also demonstrate excellent [[resistance to fracture]], determined in part by the mechanical properties (described above) and by the preferred [[failure mode]], which is a function of the [[reinforcement architecture]] and [[fiber/matrix interface]]. The [[polymer matrix]] [[is prepared]] by combining epoxy, crosslinker, and filler (as-needed), which controls the [[crosslinking density]] and [[heterogeneity]] within the matrix structure. [[The choice and preparation of reinforcement]] sets the [[morphology]] and [[microstructure of the reinforcement phase]]. The architecture of the reinforcement (and therefore, composite) is set during [[layup and curing]] and is defined by the [[dispersion]], [[aggregation]], and [[orientation of the reinforcement]]. [[Post-layup annealing and aging]] can improve the [[matrix/reinforcement interface]], and is critical to the mechanical properties, particularly the failure mode and toughness.","[{""groupname"":""polymercompositeexample"",""task"":""para"",""lightweightmechanical"":""Performance"",""toughness"":""Property"",""lowdensity"":""Property"",""strengthstiffness"":""Property"",""extremeenvironments"":""Performance"",""slowdegradationrateswhenexposedtoo2h2oandsalts"":""Property"",""thermalexpansioncoefficientmismatch"":""Property"",""glasstransitiontemperaturetg"":""Property"",""resistancetofracture"":""Performance"",""failuremode"":""Property"",""reinforcementarchitecture"":""Structure"",""fibermatrixinterface"":""Structure"",""polymermatrix"":""Structure"",""isprepared"":""Processing"",""crosslinkingdensity"":""Structure"",""heterogeneity"":""Structure"",""thechoiceandpreparationofreinforcement"":""Processing"",""morphology"":""Structure"",""microstructureofthereinforcementphase"":""Structure"",""layupandcuring"":""Processing"",""dispersion"":""Structure"",""aggregation"":""Structure"",""orientationofthereinforcement"":""Structure"",""postlayupannealingandaging"":""Processing"",""matrixreinforcementinterface"":""Structure""},{""groupname"":""polymercompositeexample"",""task"":""SDC"",""isprepared"":[""aggregation""],""thechoiceandpreparationofreinforcement"":[""reinforcementarchitecture"",""polymermatrix"",""microstructureofthereinforcementphase"",""orientationofthereinforcement"",""matrixreinforcementinterface""],""layupandcuring"":[""crosslinkingdensity"",""heterogeneity""],""postlayupannealingandaging"":[""fibermatrixinterface"",""morphology"",""dispersion""],""reinforcementarchitecture"":[""toughness"",""strengthstiffness"",""failuremode""],""fibermatrixinterface"":[""thermalexpansioncoefficientmismatch"",""glasstransitiontemperaturetg""],""polymermatrix"":[""lowdensity""],""crosslinkingdensity"":[""lowdensity""],""heterogeneity"":[""strengthstiffness""],""morphology"":[""toughness""],""microstructureofthereinforcementphase"":[""slowdegradationrateswhenexposedtoo2h2oandsalts""],""dispersion"":[""thermalexpansioncoefficientmismatch""],""aggregation"":[""toughness""],""orientationofthereinforcement"":[""toughness"",""strengthstiffness""],""matrixreinforcementinterface"":[""toughness"",""strengthstiffness""],""toughness"":[""lightweightmechanical"",""resistancetofracture""],""strengthstiffness"":[""lightweightmechanical"",""resistancetofracture""],""lowdensity"":[""lightweightmechanical""],""slowdegradationrateswhenexposedtoo2h2oandsalts"":[""extremeenvironments""],""thermalexpansioncoefficientmismatch"":[""extremeenvironments"",""resistancetofracture""],""glasstransitiontemperaturetg"":[""extremeenvironments""],""failuremode"":[""resistancetofracture""]}]"
Aluminum-CHiMaDExample,"An aluminum alloy is prepared by [[ingot metallurgy]].  The process begins with [[ingot refining]] then [[deoxidation]] and then [[ingot solidification]].  During ingot refining, deoxidation, and solidification, [[Fe and other impurities form coarse inclusion or ‚Äúconstituent‚Äù phases such as Al3Fe]].  In a final stage of solidification, [[finer scale ‚Äúdispersoid‚Äù particles such as Al6Mn]] precipitate.  These continue to form during [[hot working]] of the ingot.  During subsequent [[solution treatment]] the dispersoids remain out of solution and pin grain boundaries.  The alloy is [[quenched]] from the solution treatment and then [[aged]] to [[precipitate Cu G-P zones]].  The solution treatment, quenching, and aging processing stages effect the [[final matrix]] composition.  Important properties governing alloy performance in service are the [[elastic modulus]], [[yield strength]], and [[fracture toughness]].  The modulus is determined by the final matrix composition, while the strength is determined by the G-P zone precipitation and [[grain size]].  Ductile fracture is controlled by primary void formation on the constituent particles as well as finer scale microvoid formation on the dispersoids.","[{""groupname"":""aluminumchimadexample"",""task"":""para"",""ingotmetallurgy"":""processing"",""ingotrefining"":""processing"",""deoxidation"":""processing"",""ingotsolidification"":""processing"",""feandotherimpuritiesformcoarseinclusionorconstituentphasessuchasal3fe"":""structure"",""finerscaledispersoidparticlessuchasal6mn"":""structure"",""solutiontreatment"":""processing"",""hotworking"":""processing"",""quenched"":""processing"",""aged"":""processing"",""precipitatecugpzones"":""structure"",""finalmatrix"":""structure"",""elasticmodulus"":""property"",""yieldstrength"":""property"",""fracturetoughness"":""property"",""grainsize"":""structure""},{""groupname"":""aluminumchimadexample"",""task"":""SDC""}]"
Thermoelectrics_test,"The efficiency of thermoelectric devices is related to the [[figure-of-merit zT]], which combines several interrelated and competing material properties including the [[lattice thermal conductivity (ùúÖ_ùëôùëéùë°)]], [[electronic thermal conductivity(ùúÖ_ùëíùëô)]], electrical conductivity (ùúé, governed by the [[carrier mobility ùúá]] and [[carrier concentration]]), and the [[Seebeck coefficient]] (S, defined by the carrier concentration).

Emery-Exam1-M54,"In 2007, the US Navy contracted QuestTek to develop a steel that would serve on aircraft-carrier capable aircraft. The customer required a steel that had 2x [[the service life]]  and provided [[improved reliability]] over the current material. In the design of this steel, a main challenge was to maintain or improve [[strength]] (resistance to permanent deformation) and [[toughness]] (ability to absorb energy prior to fracture)  while improving [[processability]], which is how effectively a material can be made into a component. This required intentional materials design of the [[distribution of crystallites]]  and the [[arrangement of the matrix and strengthening components]] (i.e. phases) within the steel. To achieve these goals, Engineers fine-tuned the development of the heat treatments; specifically the [[tempering]] and [[hot-working]] parameters.","[{""groupname"":""emeryexam1m54"",""task"":""para"",""theservicelife"":""performance"",""improvedreliability"":""performance"",""strength"":""property"",""toughness"":""property"",""distributionofcrystallites"":""structure"",""arrangementofthematrixandstrengtheningcomponents"":""structure"",""processability"":""performance"",""tempering"":""processing"",""hotworking"":""processing""},{""groupname"":""emeryexam1m54"",""task"":""SDC"",""hotworking"":[""arrangementofthematrixandstrengtheningcomponents"",""distributionofcrystallites""],""tempering"":[""arrangementofthematrixandstrengtheningcomponents""],""arrangementofthematrixandstrengtheningcomponents"":[""toughness"",""strength""],""distributionofcrystallites"":[""toughness""],""toughness"":[""improvedreliability"",""theservicelife""],""strength"":[""improvedreliability"",""theservicelife""]}]"
