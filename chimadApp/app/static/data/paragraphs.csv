Polymer Composite Example,"Polymer matrix composites are traditionally valued for use in [[lightweight mechanical]] applications (aerospace, automotive, etc.) due to their attractive combination of mechanical properties ([[toughness]], [[strength/stiffness]]) and [[low density]]. For use in [[extreme environments]], these materials must possess [[slow degradation rates when exposed to O_{2}_, H_{2}_O, and salts]]. Moreover, maintaining structural integrity over a wide temperature range requires a low [[thermal expansion coefficient mismatch]] between matrix/reinforcement and a high [[glass transition temperature (T_{g}_)]].

Metal AM - SLM,"Additive manufacturing offers exceptional control over macroscopic part geometry, yet has encountered limitations in the available [[material portfolio]], [[mechanical properties]] of final components, and the [[economics of processing]]. Selective laser melting (SLM) is a specific class of powder-bed fusion techniques, in which a laser fully melts layers of powder onto a substrate and builds a component layer-by-layer. The key processing parameter behind the structure of printed components is the [[energy density]] delivered to the substrate; this can be controlled by a variety of machine parameters, such as [[beam power]] and [[scan speed]], and must be high enough to ensure full melting of the powder and inter-layer bonding, but low enough to avoid [[warping]] and [[cracking]] of the component. In addition to these macroscopic defects, the solidification conditions influence the microstructure of the component.

CJE BCPs for DSA,"The chief property of block copolymers (BCP) that has attracted interest in lithographic applications is its ability to [[microphase separate]]. If the [[identity of blocks]] in a BCP are chosen such that their propensity to phase separate is encouraged, the BCP can microphase separate on a surface to form [[specific and defined patterns]]. Typically, this can be induced when a solution of the BCP in a good solvent is [[applied to a surface]] as a thin film and consequently [[thermally annealed]] above the BCP‚Äôs [[glass transition temperature]], at which point there is sufficient [[mass transfer]] of the polymer chains for self-assembly via microphase separation. Furthermore, the [[domains]] of a BCP can be aligned when [[guiding patterns]] are imparted onto the BCP thin film. Of notable interest in exploring DSA materials with desired properties targeted for [[specific applications in microelectronics]] is the [[Flory-Huggins interaction parameter œá]], especially when coupled with the [[overall degree of polymerization N]] as the [[‚Äúsegregation strength‚Äù of the BCP, œáN]]. The [[chemical identity of monomers]] that compose each block of a BCP can correlate strongly with œá as a [[thermodynamic]] impetus for microphase separation and thereby greatly impact the self-assembly of BCPs with [[specified dimensions]]. In recent years, the pursuit of progressively smaller feature sizes by DSA has led to the design of BCPs that maximize œáN via ‚Äúhigh œá-low N‚Äù BCPs. However, œáN can affect both the thermodynamics and [[kinetics]] of self-assembly in contrasting ways. With increasing œá, [[self-diffusion]] of a given BCP exponentially decreases. Thus, while maximizing œáN reduces [[structural fluctuations]] to enhance [[structural uniformity]], lowering œáN allows for [[structural reorganization]] towards the [[annihilation of defects]] formed. Thus, indiscriminately maximizing œáN comes at the expense of the formation and persistence of defects. The balance of œáN between avoiding defects while simultaneously imparting structural uniformity is a primary challenge with ensuring control in the self-assembly of BCP thin films.",

Traditionally, superalloys have been nickel-based for the last seven decades, because the nickel can form both an [[FCC matrix (gamma)]] as well as coherent [[L1_{2}_ precipitates (gamma prime)]].

Gamma prime is unique because it allows a so-called ""anomalous"" [[yield strength]]. While most materials get monotonically weaker with increasing temperature, gamma prime has a high temperature ""hump"" where the yield strength may even be higher than at room temperature. While superalloys may be weaker than other materials at room temperature, gamma prime's anomalous yield cannot be beaten at high temperature.

Cobalt is a promising alternative to nickel, because it has a higher [[melting point]]. However, research into producing cobalt-based gamma prime is still in its infancy. There is only a small window of  [[element compositions]] which can make gamma prime, and much larger windows that can form brittle [[Topologically Close-Packed (TCP)]] phases. Creep properties are also be affected by [[grain size]], [[grain boundary precipitates]], and [[lattice misfit]], which is the crystallographic size difference between gamma and gamma prime.

Alloys are made by [[weighing element constituents]], [[arc melting]] ingots, [[homogenizing]] to remove the as-cast microstructure and develop a homogenous gamma matrix, and [[aging]] to precipitate gamma prime within the matrix.

Cobalt has a disadvantage compared to nickel because of its higher [[cost]]. Additionally, the most-developed gamma prime composition is Co_{3}_(W,Al), which has high [[density]] because of tungsten.","[{""groupname"":""cobasedsuperalloysbrandon4"",""task"":""para"",""withstandextremeconditions"":""performance"",""oxidationcorrosionresistance"":""property"",""mechanicalpropertiesathightemperature"":""performance"",""creepresistance"":""property"",""fccmatrixgamma"":""structure"",""l12precipitatesgammaprime"":""structure"",""yieldstrength"":""property"",""meltingpoint"":""property"",""elementcompositions"":""structure"",""topologicallyclosepackedtcp"":""structure"",""grainsize"":""structure"",""grainboundaryprecipitates"":""structure"",""latticemisfit"":""structure"",""weighingelementconstituents"":""processing"",""arcmelting"":""processing"",""homogenizing"":""processing"",""aging"":""processing"",""cost"":""performance"",""density"":""property""},{""groupname"":""cobasedsuperalloysbrandon4"",""task"":""SDC"",""weighingelementconstituents"":[""fccmatrixgamma"",""elementcompositions"",""latticemisfit"",""l12precipitatesgammaprime"",""topologicallyclosepackedtcp"",""grainboundaryprecipitates""],""arcmelting"":[""grainsize""],""homogenizing"":[""fccmatrixgamma""],""aging"":[""grainboundaryprecipitates"",""topologicallyclosepackedtcp"",""l12precipitatesgammaprime""],""latticemisfit"":[""creepresistance""],""fccmatrixgamma"":[""meltingpoint"",""density"",""creepresistance"",""oxidationcorrosionresistance""],""l12precipitatesgammaprime"":[""density"",""yieldstrength"",""creepresistance""],""topologicallyclosepackedtcp"":[""creepresistance""],""grainsize"":[""yieldstrength"",""creepresistance""],""grainboundaryprecipitates"":[""yieldstrength""],""density"":[""cost""],""meltingpoint"":[""withstandextremeconditions"",""mechanicalpropertiesathightemperature""],""creepresistance"":[""withstandextremeconditions"",""mechanicalpropertiesathightemperature""],""oxidationcorrosionresistance"":[""withstandextremeconditions"",""cost""],""yieldstrength"":[""mechanicalpropertiesathightemperature"",""withstandextremeconditions""]}]"

test,"There are several material design requirements for block copolymers for [[directed-self assembly applications]].

dsa_finalmaybe,"The chief property of block copolymers (BCP) that has attracted interest in lithographic applications is its ability to [[microphase separate]]. BCPs [[are synthesized]] with [[low polydispersities]].  If the [[identity of blocks]] in a BCP are chosen such that their propensity to phase separate is encouraged, the BCP can microphase separate on a surface to form [[well defined features]]. Typically, this can be induced when a solution of the BCP in a good solvent is [[spin coated]] as a [[thin film]] and consequently [[thermally annealed]] above the BCP‚Äôs [[glass transition temperature]]. In order to achieve [[perpendicular assembly]], the two polymer blocks need [equal surface energies] at the free surface. Of notable interest in exploring DSA materials with desired properties targeted for [[specific applications in microelectronics]] is the [[Flory-Huggins interaction parameter œá]], especially when coupled with the [[overall degree of polymerization N]] as the [[‚Äúsegregation strength‚Äù of the BCP, œáN]]. The chemical identity of monomers that compose each block of a BCP can correlate strongly with œá as a thermodynamic impetus for microphase separation and thereby greatly impact the self-assembly of BCPs with specified dimensions. In recent years, the pursuit of progressively smaller feature sizes by DSA has led to the design of BCPs that maximize œáN via ‚Äúhigh œá-low N‚Äù BCPs. However, œáN can affect both the thermodynamics and kinetics of self-assembly in contrasting ways. With increasing œá, self-diffusion of a given BCP exponentially decreases. Thus, while maximizing œáN reduces structural fluctuations to enhance structural uniformity, lowering œáN allows for structural reorganization towards the [[annihilation of defects]] formed. Thus, indiscriminately maximizing œáN comes at the expense of the formation and persistence of defects. The balance of œáN between avoiding defects while simultaneously imparting structural uniformity is a primary challenge with ensuring control in the self-assembly of BCP thin films. In order to achieve [[alignment]] of the BCPs with [[low defectivity]], fabrication of [[precise chemical guiding patterns]] is necessary.
