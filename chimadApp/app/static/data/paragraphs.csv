Aluminum-CHiMaDExample,"An aluminum alloy is prepared by [[ingot metallurgy]].  The process begins with [[ingot refining]] then [[deoxidation]] and then [[ingot solidification]].  During ingot refining, deoxidation, and solidification, [[Fe and other impurities form coarse inclusion or “constituent” phases such as Al3Fe]].  In a final stage of solidification, [[finer scale “dispersoid” particles such as Al6Mn]] precipitate.  These continue to form during [[hot working]] of the ingot.  During subsequent [[solution treatment]] the dispersoids remain out of solution and pin grain boundaries.  The alloy is [[quenched]] from the solution treatment and then [[aged]] to [[precipitate Cu G-P zones]].  The solution treatment, quenching, and aging processing stages effect the [[final matrix]] composition.  Important properties governing alloy performance in service are the [[elastic modulus]], [[yield strength]], and [[fracture toughness]].  The modulus is determined by the final matrix composition, while the strength is determined by the G-P zone precipitation and [[grain size]].  Ductile fracture is controlled by primary void formation on the constituent particles as well as finer scale microvoid formation on the dispersoids.","[{""groupname"":""Aluminum-CHiMaDExample"",""task"":""para"",""ingotmetallurgy"":""processing"",""ingotrefining"":""processing"",""deoxidation"":""processing"",""ingotsolidification"":""processing"",""feandotherimpuritiesformcoarseinclusionorconstituentphasessuchasal3fe"":""structure"",""finerscaledispersoidparticlessuchasal6mn"":""structure"",""solutiontreatment"":""processing"",""hotworking"":""processing"",""quenched"":""processing"",""aged"":""processing"",""precipitatecugpzones"":""structure"",""finalmatrix"":""structure"",""elasticmodulus"":""property"",""yieldstrength"":""property"",""fracturetoughness"":""property"",""grainsize"":""structure""},{""groupname"":""Aluminum-CHiMaDExample"",""task"":""SDC""}]"
